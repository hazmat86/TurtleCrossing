# TurtleCrossing
Turtle Crossing is a game that is based of the classic arcade hit Frogger. It's written in python and is designed to be object oriented. This game will show my ability to handle a variety of programming concepts such as loops, variables, classes, functions, importing modules and others. This is being developed for the 100 Days of Python course by Angela Yu on Udemy.
